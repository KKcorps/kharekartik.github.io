<p>People who are friends with me on Facebook are perfectly aware of the fact that I go on a status marathon whenever I'm on vacation. But this time, I'm taking that up a notch and so, I present to you my new blog where I'll be pouring my heart out during these two months.</p>
<p class="section-heading">But why a blog?</p>
<p>In the past few months, some really screwed up decisions led me to some place (popularly known as Gurgaon) other than where most of my friends have landed. My friends will die without me and thus, this blog will rejoice them. Below is the collage of bunch of idiots (who are doing much better than me so I don't know what that makes me) I hang out with.Btw, kakul why don't I have a pic with you?</p>

<p>Since memories are the only constant in this ever changing worlds, I hope this blog will create some memeories for all of us and will be the right way to begin a story that will never end.</p>
<p class="section-heading">So what about my old blog?</p>
<p>Ohh I completely forgot about that!!!!</p>
<p>Just Kidding, actually my old <a href="https://kkcrps.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blog</a> got cluttered with a lot of nonsensical posts and so I thought of starting from scratch. Also, having your own site is way much cooler.</p>

<p>So I bid you farewell for now.<br>
Till my next post,<br>
Sayo Nara</p>
