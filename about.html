<p>Hey,</p>

<p>My name is Kartik Khare and I'm not a Marathi (or a Sri lankan for that matter.Don't know why people keep saying that).I am a happy-go-lucky guy and I take that too literally.You'll always see me walking (or hopping) with a smile on my face.I'm not a loquacious person but yeah I'm a very good listener and that makes me a good company.</p>
<p>As far my academics is concerned, I'm a final year undergraduate student doing my bachelors in Electronics &amp; Communication from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee.Even being told that it has great scope, I chose to be a developer because <i>Mah Life, mah ... </i> Naah! not that, I just love it.</p>
<p>I work mostly on Android and Python but am fairly acquainted with PHP, JS, Node.js and C#.I'm an ardent linux fan and I change my distros like people change their wallpapers.At present, I've Elemenetory OS, Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8.1 running on my system although I'll be updating to windows 10 really soon.</p> 
<p>My taste in music is eclectic.You'll find me listening from punjabi to metal, from electronic to symphonies, from Eminem to Arijit singh.I have music for all and that makes me the perfect companion for long journeys.</p>
<p>I'm not a voracious reader but past few months have turned me into a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank"> HN</a> addict and a sucker for sci-fi novels.</p>
<p>You can always ping me on <a href="mailto:kharekartik@gmail.com">kharekartik@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you have an idea and want me to work on it, contact me on <strong>+917830268264</strong>.
